*Goal*: Determine the team''s learning expectations and availability.

*Commitment*:
> It is critical to make sure that everyone is realistic in their level of commitment and availability.
> Working less than you commit to is disrespectful to your teammates and can stunt the team''s progress and morale.
> Typically team members commit 4-10 hours a week towards the project.
> 

*Life Happens*
> Events sometimes occur in peoples lives that will prevent them from honoring a commitment.
> As a team member, *make sure that you notify your PM as soon as possible* if a situation arises that forces you to leave the project or makes it impossible for you to meet your deadlines.
> *For PM''s* - Notify the Chingu Management Team if a situation arises that makes it difficult or impossible to complete your committments to your team and project
> There is nothing wrong with having to pull back or drop out - communication is the key to being a good Chingu.

*Learning Goals*:
> Evaluate everyone''s current technical abilities.
> Determine at least one primary technical learning goal for each teammate
> Pick something that is 25% outside of the team''s comfort zone / skillset. Any further and you will likely be overwhelmed. Any less and you are limiting your rate of learning.

*Goal*: Decide on which workflow tools and techniques the team will use.

*Tips*:
> The workflow is the heart of your team''s progress. It''s important for all team members to understand the need for an organized workflow.
> Don''t go overboard! Workflow tools are only useful when they are used. Keep it simple so using the tools feels effortless rather than a chore.
> If you don''t already have a workflow or specific tools in mind, consider the suggestions below.

*Suggested Workflow Tools*
>Besides the obvious Slack and Github, the following are tools that work for many Chingu teams
> <https://www.waffle.io|Waffle> - Trello and Github had a baby that makes project management a breeze
> <https://www.discord.com|Discord> - "Always-on" communication tool. Leave it on mute while you work then unmute as needed to gain access to teammates for problem solving detours. Use it for clear audio while using Google Hangouts (don''t forget to mute the echo from Hangouts!)
> <https://hangouts.google.com|Google Hangouts> - A screensharing / pair-programming must (until VSC Live comes out!!)
> <https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/pmrok/wiki/Resources-Tools#project-management-organization-tools|Other Workflow Tools> - A more comprehensive list of tools Chingu''s have used and recommended. 

*Suggested Workflow*:
> Hold a meeting on Discord and / or Hangouts to discuss the key steps required to complete the next sprint.
> Use Waffle to compartmentalize the steps of the sprints into grab-and-go tasks.
> Leave Discord on and unmute as needed to discuss and conquer roadblocks.
> Use Slack for short code snippets. Use Hangouts to screenshare for more complex debugging.

*A proper workflow and concise collection of workflow tools is what makes the difference between a team that makes it and one that doesn''t.*

> Don''t get turned off because the setup seems daunting. It''s a one time process - don''t build up technical debt!

*Required*:
> Make sure everyone uses the tools.
> Walk through an example usage of each tool and how they all come together.
> Work out any kinks in everyone''s microphones, internet connections, permissions, etc.

> Defining the MVP is committing to the bare minimum you and the team will accomplish before the cohort''s deadline.

*Focus Points*:
> Front End - consider the views and their associated functionality
> Back End - consider the endpoints, routes and associated logic
> Database - consider the complexity of the database and associated models
> Deployment - consider how / where you will host the project

*Schedule a Meeting*
> Schedule your next meeting to plan your first sprint!

*Don't throw away those features and moonshot ideas that fall outside of the scope of the MVP!*
*Shoot for finishing the MVP ahead of schedule so the extra time can be used to implement those additional features and polish*

*Goal*: Adding descriptions to javascript functions, making sure everything is optimal and without magic numbers

*Rules of Thumb*:
> Be explicit - always keep in mind readability and maintainability. 
> DRY - don''t repeat yourself
> Comments are to explain *_why_* not *_how_*.
> Naming is arguably the hardest thing we do as developers but the one with the biggest payback.

*Term*:
> Magic numbers are numbers that occur multiple time in code without an explicit meaning. They should preferably be replaced by named constants.
> finalPrice = dutyFreePrice + (dutyFreePrice * 0.25); BAD
> var TAX = 0.25; finalPrice = dutyFreePrice + (dutyFreePrice * TAX); GOOD
> The no-magic-numbers rule aims to make code more readable and refactoring easier by ensuring that special numbers are declared as constants to make their meaning explicit.

*Task*:
> Optimize your code and avoid repetition
> Someday, you''ll thank yourself for deleting all those nasty magic numbers.
> Every function needs a description.
> Comments are your best friend!

*Tips*:
> As a general rule, functions should be about 18 lines long. If there are any longer, you can probably make an additional functions somewhere to ensure readablity of your code.
> Maybe you can''t imagine it now, but in just about 6 month, you will surely have written so many lines of code that you will forget everything in this project!
> This happens even to a grand Wizard like me! That is why it is important to write precise and clear descriptions for any function in your javascript code.
> This will ensure that even if you go back to it after a year, you will find everything you need fast.
